          <p class="style5">Generous Donors Nationwide Support BFCS Client</p>
          <p class="style4">Great-grandmother Sarah Coleman celebrates her new dentures every day</p>
          <p class="style2">Following an article in the July 10, 2008 edition of the Wall Street Journal, a 67 year-old great-grandmother and client of Black Family and Child Services (BFCS) found herself to be the recipient of life-changing dental work that was made possible by generous cash contributions to the agency.</p>
          <p class="style2"><span class="style4">Mrs. Coleman's Story</span><br>
            The story described a sobering situation affecting thousands of families nationwide—elderly grandparents and great-grandparents who are saddled with caring for the young children of parents who have disappeared, or who are spending time in prison.
  
Ms Coleman is caring for the three young children of her granddaughter. Their mother is struggling to earn a living and cannot care for the kids full-time. The children’s fathers arein prison. 
  
Her limited fixed income and willingness to care for her great-grandchildren had compromised her ability to care for herself. There just wasn’t any money left over to pay for the substantial amount of dental work that she needed, or the purchase of new dentures.
  
“I just wanted to eat again,” said Ms Coleman.</p>
          <p class="style2"><span class="style4">Support Comes from Donars Nationwide</span><br> 
            When the article was published in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, life as she had known it had changed forever.</p>
          <p class="style2">Mary Black, president and CEO of BFCS began receiving calls from generous donors from across the country. Many donors sent hundreds of dollars and wished to remain anonymous to be able to help Ms Coleman receive the dental care that she desperately needed.</p>
          <p class="style2"> Ms Black contacted Phoenix dentist Bruce A. Sprigner, who created a team of professionals who performed oral surgery, maxillofacial surgery, restorative dentistry and lab services. In addition to Dr. Sprigner’s services, surgical services were also provided by Jack Burhow, DDS, MS and lab services were provided by QDS Laboratories and Zia Laboratories.</p>
          <p class="style2">It took many months to complete the process, but today, Ms. Coleman is proud of her new smile, and she has a new outlook on life. “I thank God daily for my new teeth. This has truly changed my life for the better,” she says.</p>
          <p class="style2"> “Sarah’s overall health has greatly improved,” said Dr. Sprigner. “Now she receives all the proper nutrition that she needs because she can chew her food properly.” </p>
          <p class="style2">“I used to only be able to eat soft and blended foods because it hurt to chew, but now I can eat anything and I want to thank all of the generous individuals who made this possible,” Ms Coleman added.
