              <span class="style5">Volunteer Opportunities </span>
              </p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Black Family and Child Services has a variety of ways that you can make a difference as a volunteer.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Please review the following options. If you would like to volunteer, we would like to hear from you.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Please call 602-243-1773 to learn more.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Food and Nutrition Program</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">The BFCS Food and Nutrition Program provides a variety of lectures, workshops and training classes.  Volunteers are needed to operate and present these exciting programs. Please contact BFCS if you would like to provide any of the following services:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="style2">Assemble and Distribute Food Boxes</li>
              <li class="style2">Nutritional Workshops (i.e. childhood obesity, diabetes, hypertension</li>
              <li class="style2"><span class="style2">Food Demonstrations</span><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Host a Fundraiser for BFCS</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Whether it’s a breakfast, lunch or cocktail hour meeting, your office or facility could be a convenient location for BFCS staff to make an informal presentation about ways that financial contributions can make a big difference in the lives of children available for foster homes. We need you to invite potential donors.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Sponsor a New BFCS Video</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Underwriters are needed to provide financial support for BFCS to update its 10-minute video presentation about the agency, its services and the desperate need for foster and adoptive homes in the Valley. Production and duplication costs will be approximately $10,000.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Donors may contribute the entire amount or a portion of this production cost.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Support Miss Mary’s Closet</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">We frequently serve children who have never received a single article of new clothing in their lives. For every $25 that is raised, one deserving child can receive a complete outfit of new clothing, shoes and undergarments through the Miss Mary’s Closet program.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Children from economically disadvantaged households can qualify for the program, which accepts either new clothing or cash contributions so that new clothing can be purchased.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">This program also provides emergency clothing for foster children who have been removed from homes where they are in peril.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Donate New Computers</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">The BFCS Computer Lab is in dire need of updating 12 outdated computer work stations that are used for both child and adult computer skills training classes.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2"> We need your support through donations of new computer equipment or cash for the purpose of purchasing new computer equipment.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Donate Your Company’s Products or Services</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">The cost of raising foster children often exceeds the reimbursement provided by the State of Arizona for items like clothing, food, day care, and birthday or holiday gifts. Foster parents sincerely appreciate the generosity of companies and organizations that provide free products or discounts on the purchase of essential products.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Become a Foster Mentor/Angel</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">BFCS is seeking a one-year commitment from adults who are willing to provide both financial support and time to spend mentoring a foster child.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Adopt-A-Family for the Holidays</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">This annual program enables supporters to fulfill the holiday wishes of an economically disadvantaged family.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">BFCS client submit a Wish List to the agency in November that lists personal items, clothing items and toys that children would like to receive for Christmas. Most often, children are in single-parent households and donors can choose how large a family to support based on their ability to give.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Library Volunteers</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2"> BFCS has a Family Resource Center community library in which volunteers can organize and catalog books for both children and adults, or read aloud to children who are clients of the agency.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">Day and early evening shifts can be tailored to individual volunteers’ schedules. We ask that volunteers be willing to commit to at least eight hours of volunteer service per month.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style4">Sponsor a BFCS Educational Conference</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">The agency is planning a major educational conference in late 2010 or early 2011 to present information to community leaders and interested citizens regarding the need to help abused and neglected children in the Valley.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2"> We are seeking those who would be willing to make financial contributions to underwrite conference costs, speakers who can present workshop sessions and volunteers to staff registration tables.</p>
            <p align="left" class="style2">For more information, please call 602-243-1773. <br>
